# HTML & CSS Notes

HyperText Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets - notes

## Semantic HTML

- Writing semantic HTML means giving meaning to the elements we use.
- Semantic HTML focuses on providing meaning and purpose for the elements you use.
- Some of the benefits of semantic HTML:
  - It makes your code machine-readable. Browsers and search engines will better understand your website.
  - It helps you make sense of the information on the page.
  - It helps you maintain the code as it makes it a lot more readable.

## Headings

- The h1 to h6 elements represent six levels of section headings. h1 is the highest section level, and h6 is the lowest.
- The h4, h5, and h6 elements are not very frequently used. You don't have to use all heading elements. It depends on the content that you're representing.
- Avoid skipping heading levels. If you have an h1, the following heading level under it should be h2.

## Heading: h1

- The heading 1 h1 element is used to represent the highest-level, most important topic of the current web page.
- h1 is the most important topic of the page
- When writing HTML code, it's important to focus on the semantics rather than the appearance. HTML is meant for the content, and the structure, whereas CSS is used to style that content (appearance).
- You should not use an HTML element based on its appearance but rather its meaning/purpose/role.
- If you're not sure which element should be labeled as the h1 on the page, ask yourself: What is the most important topic on this page?

## Accessibility

- In the context of HTML (and websites in general), accessibility refers to making your website usable for everyone.
- People have a range of abilities.
- As we get older, our functional abilities deteriorate.
- Here are some benefits of accessibility:
  - It's a technical skill that you add to your tool belt.
  - It helps you practice empathy.
  - It increases the conversion rate for your product as you allow more people to use it.
  - You get to decide whether you give people access or deny them access to your product. By making it accessible, you are allowing them to access it.
  - In some countries or organizations, accessibility is a legal requirement. That is the case in several countries.
- A screen reader is a software that has commands to jump between headings or specific landmark regions quickly.
- A survey of screen reader users concludes that they usually navigate an unfamiliar page by exploring the headings.
